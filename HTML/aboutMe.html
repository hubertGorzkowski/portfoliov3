				<div class="howItStarted text">
					<p>
						I became interested in creating websites in the last year of
						technical school. I started my adventure by watching materials on
						youtube to prepare for the lessons. The subject interested me, so I
						did a course on the basics of HTML and CSS on the Udemy platform. I
						enjoyed this so I started doing more courses learning about new
						possibilities and technologies.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="whatKnow text">
					<p>
						Up to this point, I've learned HTML, CSS, BEM methodologies, SASS
						preprocessors, JavaScript, AJAX, github and the basics of React. Due
						to the fact that I went to the IT technician profile many things did
						not cause me problems, such as using the console and commands.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="whatDoingNow text">
					<p>
						I am currently working as a fiber optic installer. Due to work, I'm
						only home on weekends, so I don't have much time to study. Despite
						everything, I'm still learning because it gives me a lot of joy and
						I would like to work as a front-end developer.
